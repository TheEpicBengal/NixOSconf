After years of looking for the best linux desktop experience trying to ditch windows I settled on NixOS.
Years of package breakages, broken updates, switching between OS's and failing to find a unified desktop experience led me here.
Avoiding all the pitfalls of Arch, Gentoo and Debian based linux distros. 

Why NixOS?
- Immutable, All packages are stored seperately to avoid dependency hell
- Reproducible, I can put my config on my laptop and have all my programs
- Declarative, System management is in one file, It just works flawlessly
- Stable, I can rollback within 30 seconds and have all my personal files
- Good mesa drivers for gaming and packages are relatively new
- Rolling release, stable or both for individual packages
- One of the biggest package repos on Linux
